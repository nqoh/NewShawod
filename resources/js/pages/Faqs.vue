    <label class="ac-label" for="ac-2">What is a domain name?<i></i></label>
    <div class="article ac-content">
      <p>A domain name is the actual name of a website (e.g. www.shawod.co.za), and every single website has a domain name. To obtain one, you need to purchase it through a domain registrar. Domains can cost anywhere from a few dollars a year to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, based on the contract and popularity of the domain. Every domain name is actually pointing to an IP (Internet Protocol) address, which is a series of numbers. Because most people can’t remember 10 digits in perfect order, domain names serve as easily-remembered alias for visitors, if you need one please include it on your Cart.</p>

    <label class="ac-label" for="ac-13">What is Web Hosting?<i></i></label>
    <div class="article ac-content">
      <p>Web hosting is the service of storing data that keeps websites up and running for users. Every single website that is online has a host server, and almost all use a web host to manage that storage. Not all web hosts provide the same level of quality, though. Uptime, and data speed and quantity of transfer are the best measures of a host’s success. You can often pay more to get data transferred in higher quantities, faster. Most web hosts offer unlimited bandwidth and disk space at a speed that is perfectly fine for small-to-moderate sized businesses or individuals.</p>

    <input class="ac-input" id="ac-14" name="accordion-1" type="checkbox" />
    <label class="ac-label" for="ac-14">Can I buy web hosting without a domain name?<i></i></label>
    <div class="article ac-content">
      <p>While they both work together, the domain name and the web hosting service are two different things and can each function in different ways. However, without a domain name there would be no way to access or lead to the information stored in your hosting account. Therefore, the hosting couldn't function. Domain names, however, can be purchased without web hosting. These domains are considered 'Parked' until such time as their name servers are delegated (or pointed) to a webhost.</p>

    <!-- accordion item 4 -- start -->
    <input class="ac-input" id="ac-15" name="accordion-1" type="checkbox" />
    <label class="ac-label" for="ac-15">What is disk space and how much do I need?<i></i></label>
    <div class="article ac-content">
      <p>Disk space refers to the total space available for a user to store files on at any time. Files may be any type - HTML, images, videos – and at any single given time, the total file size may not exceed the disk space. How much disk space you need is dependent on what type of media and interactions you’ll be hosting through your site. Your email account’s storage is also counted in disk space, so if you have large files that will sit in the account, that will boost your disk space needs. Remember that although you might not need much space now, you want wiggle room to expand and grow in the future, without switching hosts.</p>

    <input class="ac-input" id="ac-16" name="accordion-1" type="checkbox" />
    <label class="ac-label" for="ac-16">How do I obtain a dedicated email account? (me@mywebsite.com)<i></i></label>
    <div class="article ac-content">
      <p>When you purchase an account with a web host, one of the services you receive is a certain number of dedicated email accounts for any domain hosted on that account. Some web hosts give you one email account, or 10 email accounts, or unlimited email accounts. Those email accounts are managed from the control panel of the web host, please view our Hosting Packages.</p>

    <label class="ac-label" for="ac-17">How will I know how many people visited my site?<i></i></label>
    <div class="article ac-content">
      <p>You can find out how many people visited your site through a number of different third party resources, here at Shawod we can offer you a unique tool to monitor your traffic or incorporate a third party tool into your website to start tracking, It’s important that businesses install some sort of traffic counting tool on every page of a site and regularly decipher the data to make improvements to marketing and sales plans.
