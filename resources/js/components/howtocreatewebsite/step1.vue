                        'Geeky' words that may appear along the way, although we always try by all means to avoid them but
                         sometimes you just have to be precise.</p>

                        <p>Assuming you have an idea (and content, ofcourse.) and want to put it online, then follow these easy steps.</p>

                            <h1 class="title">Step 1 - Gather your Content</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div class="clients wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="500ms" data-wow-delay="300ms">
                        <p>  
                            Firstly you will need to gather all the content you want to be on your website like the 
                            images, texts, disclaimer, your company's description etc... <br>To get practical we will need
                             to use an example, let's say for example you own a Lodge and want a website for it. </p>

<p>Your Lodge wants to keep the current clients, reach more people and also attract tourists alike and in this Day in age -where people are always glued
to their smartphones and turn to search engines for advices- Billboards and Flyers are just not as effective as before. </p>
<p> Now you are not sure about how many people (Traffic) are going to visit your website but since you also want to be on the first page on Google you can expect a lot

You want your clients to see the pictures of your rooms maybe have a Gallery of 10 pictures with a little of description below your pictures, and have a homepage with
a slide of 3 photos, also have a page where your clients can fill a 'contact us' form, remember you will also need a Content Management System (CMS) to see these messages. </p><br>
<p>To edit some of your content from time to time you will need a CMS for each additional page, now let's say you want to edit the Homepage, Photo Gallery and the
Disclaimer, that's 3 additional CMS.</p>
<p>Now that you have prioritized the core pages of your business, let's add other typical pages of a website like the About us, Disclaimer and Terms of Use/Policy Page,
making it 3 Additional Pages.</p><br>
<p>To ice the cake we will add webmail addresses to complement our website, e.g. info@yourlodge.com</p>
<h2>In Total we need -:</h2>
<p><b><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>  Traffic - </b> Duluxe host.</p>
<p><b><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>  Google - </b>  Ultimate S.E.O. </p>
    <p><b><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>  10 Pictures - </b> 2*5 Photo Gallery </p>
    <p><b><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>  Form - </b>  1 Form </p>
    <p><b><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>  CMS - </b>  4 Content Management System </p>
    <p><b><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>  Number of pages - </b>  6 pages </p>
    <p><b><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>  Email - </b>  1*5 webmail </p> <br>
     <p> If you think this CMS process might puzzle you can skip it and on our clients portal you can let us know of any changes you need at a low rate.<br>
Now that you know exactly what you need you can proceed to the next step.</p>
